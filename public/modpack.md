title: Modpack
---

The server runs a custom modpack. You will need [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/), [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app), or any other Minecraft instance manager in order to install the modpack and join. We recommend Prism.

You can either download the Prism instance, or the standalone modpack. The Prism instance has Packwiz preinstalled, and on each game launch will **automatically sync and update mods** to match the server. You will only need to download this once.\
The standalone modpack will need to be manually downloaded on each modpack update, but is compatible with Curseforge.

### Packwiz (Automatic Updates)
Packwiz is a package manager that can be bootstrapped into the Minecraft launcher, to automatically download and update modpacks. Follow the instructions on the [Packwiz website](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/installing/packwiz-installer/), and set the URL to `https://cweamcraft.net/packdata/client/pack.toml`, or download the auto-updating instance at the top of the page.
